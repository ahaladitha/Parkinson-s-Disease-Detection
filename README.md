# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
This is a disease detection machine learning model for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.
Parkinson’s Disease is a special type of neurological condition and for it to be successfully treated and managed, early detection, attention and diagnosis are very essential. Recent research has demonstrated that early signs of PD might include changes in speech, such as those in speaking rate and voice quality.

The Parkinson’s Disease Detector using Machine Learning provides a brand-new method for identifying the disease using speech alterations. It is a machine learning model that can analyze speech samples and reliably identify the illness. Several speech characteristics such as pitch, jitter, and shimmer which are well-known to be impacted by the illness are examined.

The deflections in the voice will confirm the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Huge amount of data is collected from the normal person and also previously affected person by Parkinson’s disease, this data is trained using machine learning algorithms. From the whole data 60% is used for training and 40% is used for testing. The data of any person can be entered in database to check whether the person is affected by Parkinson’s disease or not. There are 24 columns in the data set each column will indicate the symptom values of a patient except the status column. The status column has 0's and 1’s which will decide if the person is effected with Parkinson’s disease or not (0-negative, 1-positive).

This method performs well when applied to a dataset of speech samples from people with and without this disease.
